# Measurement

## Fundamental and derived SI units

The metric system is just better than the imperial system. That's all you gotta know.

<Card type="definition">
### The metric system
Good system :\)

### The imperial system
Bad system >:\(
</Card>

<Card type="note">
### Did You Know?
The metric system was invented by the french. Man, I love France!
</Card>

<Card type="tip">
### Advice
ALWAYS use the metric system. It's just that simple.
</Card> 

<Card type="caution">
### Caution
NEVER use the imperial system, no matter what! OKAY!? Get that through your head...
</Card>

<Card type="example">
### Here's An Anecdote
1999: A disaster investigation board reports that NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter burned up in the Martian atmosphere,
because engineers failed to convert units from imperial to metric. Mildly infuriating ain't it?

## Scientific notation and metric multipliers

Scientific notation consists of a decimal number ranging from 1 up to below 10 multiplied by a power of 10.
Metric multpliers are prefixes added before an SI unit in order to express a different order of magnitude.

New line hehehe...

## Significant figures

For a certain value, all figures are significant, except:

-Leading zeros

-Trailing zeros if this value does not have a decimal point

When multiplying or dividing numbers, the number of significant figures of the result value should not exceed the least precise value of the calculation.
The number of significant figures in any answer should be consistent with the number of significant figures of the given data in the question.

## Orders of magnitude

Orders of magnitude are given in powers of 10, likewise those given in the scientific notation section previously.
Orders of magnitude are used to compare the size of physical data.
    
## Estimation

Estimations are usually made to the nearest power of 10. Some examples are given in the tables in the orders of magnitude section.

# Fluid dynamics (HL only)

## Fluids

The term fluid is used to describe substances which can flow: liquids or gases.
If a gas which is free to expand is heated, its volume will increase, so that at a higher temperature it has a lower density \(same mass\).
If it is not able to expand when it is heated, its density will remain unchanged, but the pressure will increase.
Most liquids expand slightly when they are heated, so that there will be a small decrease in density.

## Flow characteristics

When fluid is in motion, its flow can be laminar or turbulent.
The flow is said to be steady, or laminar, if each particle of the fluid follows a smooth path, such that the paths of different particles never cross each other.
In steady flow, the velocity of the fluid at any point remains constant in time.
Turbulent flow is irregular flow characterized by small whirlpool-like regions.

# What is Acsdemy
Acsdemy is a website designed to help ACS students prepare better for examinations, amongst a number of different purposes.

# Why did we make this 
- The current resources (acroar.com) is very lacking in terms of content and usability, and some of the links are misdirected and/or do not work anymore. This website seeks to improve that 
- Accessing the specific link isnt exactly the most intuitive, as the website is also filled with other projects/news from the SRC
- We needed a CAS project. That was probably the biggest reason tbh.

##### If you have any questions, feel free to contact one of the main people (but make sure you contact the right person because that would probably not be a good idea to ask Ryan about code when he failed comsci for like 2 years straight)
